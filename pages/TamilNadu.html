        <p> <b>Tamil Nadu</b> is the southernmost state of India. The tenth largest Indian state by area and the sixth largest by population, Tamil Nadu is the home of the Tamil people, who speak the Tamil language, one of the longest surviving classical languages and which serves as its official language. The capital and largest city is Chennai.
        Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula, with the river Kaveri bisecting the state. Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry. It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island.The name is derived from Tamil language with nadu meaning "land" and Tamil Nadu meaning "the land of Tamils". The origin and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it After independence, the region became the Madras State of the Republic of India and was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape.The state was renamed as Tamil Nadu, meaning "Tamil Country", in 1969. Hence, culture, cuisine and architecture have seen multiple influences over the years and have developed diversely.</p>

            <li><b>Literature</b></li>
            <p>Tamil Nadu has an independent literary tradition dating back over 2500 years from the Sangam era Early Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as the Tamil Sangams, the earliest of which, according to legend, were held on a now vanished continent far to the south of India.This includes the oldest grammatical treatise, Tolkappiyam, and the epics Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai.The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BCE.The available literature from the Sangam period was categorised and compiled into two categories based roughly on chronology: the Pati·πâe·πámƒìlka·πáakku consisting of E·π≠·π≠uttokai and the Pattupattu, and the Pati·πâe·πákƒ´·∏ªka·πáakku. The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book Na·πâ·πâ≈´l based on the TolkƒÅppiyam. Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely e·∏ªuttu, sol, poru·∏∑, yƒÅppu, a·πái. Tirukkural, a book on ethics by Thiruvalluvar, is amongst the most popular works of Tamil literature</p>

            <p>Dravidian architecture is the distinct style of rock architecture in Tamil Nadu In Dravidian architecture, the temples consisted of porches or mantapas preceding the door leading to the sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple, and pillared halls used for many purposes. These features are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple usually has a tank called the kalyani or pushkarni. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate at the entrance of the temple forms a prominent feature of koils and Hindu temples of the Dravidian style.They are topped by the kalasam, a bulbous stone finial and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The gopuram's origins can be traced back to the Pallavas who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram.[35] The Cholas later expanded the same and by the Pandya rule in twelfth century, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance.The state emblem also features the Lion Capital of Ashoka with an image of a Gopuram on the background.</p>
